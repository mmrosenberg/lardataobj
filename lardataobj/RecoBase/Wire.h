  /**
   * @brief Class holding the deconvoluted signals from a channel
   * @note Despite the name, this class is associated to a readout channel, not
   *       just a wire
   *
   * The channel content is expected to have been filtered from noise and
   * corrected for electronics response.
   * The content is presented as calibrated ADC counts, pedestal removed, as
   * function of time in discrete TDC units (use TimeService to discover the
   * exact extent of each tick).
   * The content is organized as time intervals where some signal is present
   * ("regions of interest", RoI), outside which we assume no signal, i.e,
   * calibrated ADC counts of 0.
   * Strictly speaking, the definition of the regions of interest is a negative
   * one: we first define where we are sure no signal is present; the rest will
   * constitute regions of interest.
   * The identification of such regions is responsibility of the algorithm
   * creating the Wire object. In the simple approach, the whole readout window
   * is stored in a single region of interest, meaning that we don't claim any
   * of the channel signal to be definitely signal free.
   * 
   * Algorithms using the regions of interest can access the channel signal
   * information either ignoring the regions of interest, and being potentially
   * flooded by zeroes from the non-signal regions:
   *     
   *     for (float ADCcount: wire.Signal()) ...
   *     
   * or they can analyze region by region:
   *     
   *     for (auto iROI = wire.begin_range(); wire.end_range(); ++iROI) {
   *       const datarange_t& ROI = *iROI;
   *       const int FirstTick = ROI.begin_index();
   *       const int EndTick = ROI.end_index();
   *       const float FirstADC = ROI[FirstTick]; // index access is by absolute tick number
   *       for (float ADC: ROI) // ... or you can just iterate through
   *       // ...
   *     } // for
   *     
   * Note that the indexed access is always by absolute tick number.
   * More examples of the use of SignalROI() return value are documented in
   * lar::sparse_vector .
   * 
   * Each channel is associated with a raw::RawDigit object. These associations
   * should be stored together with recob::Wire by the producer in a art::Assns
   * data product.
